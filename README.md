# rithmaiti
My version of a rithm game based on Stepmania and FNF, made in python

run the main.pyw program to start the game, or edit it to change the low level settings. the main settings can be changed with the startup menu.

default controls (can be changed in the file):

LEFT = (z,LEFT)

DOWN = (x,DOWN)

UP = (numpad2,UP)

RIGHT = (numpad3,RIGHT)
